## Eaglevision 2017 - Computer vision for FIRST Steamworks

### How to use
1) `git clone https://github.com/SMblyRequired/Computer-Vision-2017.git` - Clone the repo
2) `cd Computer-Vision-2017` - `cd` into the repo
3) `sudo ./installDeps.sh` - This will install `cscore`, `ntcore`, `wpiutil`, and `OpenCV v3.2.0`. Requires `sudo`.
4) `mkdir build && cd build` - Make a temporary build directory, and `cd` into it
5) `cmake ../` - This will setup the Makefile for use in step 6, based on rules in `CMakeLists.txt`
6) `make -j8` - This will compile the code into the `eaglevision` binary
7) `./eaglevision [cam ID] [headless 0/1]`

This can also be compiled using Eclipse Neon with C++ plugins, but has been tested against the steps above. Please note, we have run into trouble compiling within Eclipse after running CMake. This will require removing all files generated by CMake, and leaving only `CMakeLists.txt` at the top level of the cloned repo.
